## Introduction to HTML - Assignment
Let's Build a Game!
With your newfound knowledge from this unit, let's go ahead and create the foundation of a browser-based Memory Card Game. The goal of this exercise is to build the primary structure of a website in which we'll build the game.

## introduction to CSS

Create cards within your memory game.
Add an external CSS stylesheet.
Add color to your memory cards.

## In this assignment :

Add structure to the HTML using semantic elements.
Give the header and nav a background-color to make them stand out.
Center the main content on the page.
Adjust the spacing around elements using padding and margin to give the layout some breathing room.

## Navigation and Page
* Add a footer to the page and style the footer.
* Style the nav bar in a way that lets users know when they are hovering over a clickable item.

## Intro to JavaScript
will implement knowledge of booleans, conditionals, and arrays to help with the task of storing cards and creating your game's logic.

## Functions
For this unit's assignment, you will be adding functions to the code from the previous assignment to group together steps that perform specific tasks in our game.

## Objects
For this unit's assignment, you will be creating an object for each card that will store that card's name, the suit, and a path to where the image for that card is stored in our project.

You'll then update any code from the last assignment that was accessing values from the cards array so that we are accessing values from that specific card object.

## The DOM
Now that we've learned how to access and manipulate the DOM, let's practice by putting the finishing touches on a browser-based memory card game! We won't rely on logging messages to the console to see the game in action. And we can use our event handlers to allow a user to actually play the game!

After completing this assignment you will have a working memory game!

When the user clicks on a card, the image with the face of that card should be displayed. If the user has selected two cards, an alert should pop up letting the user know if the two cards match.
